The solution addresses the vertical field of view reduction at the cutscenes at 21:9 and wider resolutions.

1. [Download the archive](/../../releases).
2. Unpack the files to the \BrightMemoryInfinite\Binaries\Win64\ folder inside the game directory.

To uninstall, simply remove or move the files.
